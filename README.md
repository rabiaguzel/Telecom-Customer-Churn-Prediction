## üìå Notes

* The model was trained using **scikit-learn 1.6.1**; if you're using a newer version (e.g. 1.7.0), warnings may appear.
* For production, replace Flask‚Äôs development server with a WSGI server like **Gunicorn**.
* The Streamlit UI is simple ‚Äî feel free to improve the design and user experience.
